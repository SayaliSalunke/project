Title of the project : Logic Gate Simulator 

Name : Ms. Sayali Sambhaji Salunke

MIS ID : 111403040

Description of the work done : 
> Program allows to draw simple combinational circuit on the screen using toolbox.

> It opens new window named as Logic Gate Simulator containing toolbox, 
using the components in it, circuit can be drawn below it .

> All the handling is done using mouse , significant mouse movements are stored.

> Then permanently stored in the final data structure  and also in the structure 
that helps in drawing screen at every instant.

> When DONE is pressed , a procedure executes which makes stack for each
led which contains pointers pointing to all the components that determine value of 
the led , components are stored in LED TO SWITCH direction .

> And hence circuit is traced , Value at particular led is calculated

> Corresponding changes are made to the data structures . 

> Reset allows to clean up the field to draw in ckt .
